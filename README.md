Hi everyone, welcome to my GitHub page! I am XU TIANYUAN , aka Allen. I am a Data Analyst with full of ambition and confidence.

I have a strong educational background in mathematics, statistics, economics, finance, and actuarial science.I am very interested in becoming a financial data analyst to help clients maximize their profits.

In my personal life, I enjoy working out and playing basketball. Therefore, I am someone who is fearless, unafraid of challenges, and places a high value on teamwork.

In addition to continuously learning and improving my skills in data analysis, I am also studying aspects of data science, such as Machine Learning and Big Data.

I am actively seeking full-time Data Analyst job opportunities, whether in the United States or Canada. I'm fully open to relocating for the right role.

If only one person can succeed, then why can't that person be me?
